  const NEMO_FILE_TEXT = `Project NEMO – Experimental Adaptation Initiative
Creature File: NEMO_03
Classification: Adaptive Mimetic Organism
Status: ESCAPED
Threat Level: SEVERE

I. Overview
NEMO_03 is the third biological construct developed under Project NEMO, an initiative aimed at engineering a lifeform capable of perfect environmental adaptation via biological mimicry.
Unlike its predecessors (NEMO_01 and NEMO_02), which experienced systemic organ collapse during integration of composite genomes, NEMO_03 survived full procedural fusion and regenerative stabilization.
It remains the only viable organism produced by the program.

II. Genetic Composition Summary
Primary genetic sources integrated into NEMO_03:
• Deep-Sea Anglerfish (Lophiiformes) – predatory lure behaviour, facial morphology traits
• Chameleon (Chamaeleonidae) – chromatophore-based camouflage system
• Common Vampire Bat (Desmodus rotundus) – environmental preference encoding
• African Grey Parrot (Psittacus erithacus) – advanced vocal mimicry
• Common Octopus (Octopus vulgaris) – rapid dermal texture alteration
• Cuttlefish (Sepiida) – dynamic neural skin patterning
• Lyrebird (Menura novaehollandiae) – multi-source sound replication

III. Physical Description
Baseline Form (Observed Post-Stabilization):
• Height: Variable (1.5m – 2.3m when upright)
• Body Structure: Asymmetrical, elongated limbs, excessive joint articulation
• Skin: Semi-translucent dermal membrane with subdermal chromatophore clusters
• Facial Region:
  o Distended jaw hinge
  o Forward-protruding cranium
  o Dentition needle-like, recurved
  o Ocular structure recessed and reflective
  o Anglerfish-like craniofacial distortion (no photophore present)
The absence of the anglerfish bioluminescent organ was unexpected. Instead of developing a lure, cranial cartilage reshaped into a predatory visage resembling deep-sea species.
Baseline appearance has been described in internal reports as:
“Malformed. Unstructured. Anatomically profane.”

IV. Adaptive & Mimetic Capabilities
1. Vocal Replication (SUCCESSFUL)
• Perfect replication of human speech after brief exposure
• Can layer multiple vocal sources
• Demonstrates emotional tone simulation
• Frequently imitates distress calls, familiar voices, or personal identifiers
Field observation indicates it learns names rapidly.

2. Camouflage → Full Morphogenic Shift (UNINTENDED EVOLUTION)
Originally designed for pigment-based camouflage via chromatophores.
Mutation resulted in:
• Complete somatic restructuring
• Skeletal compression and expansion
• Organ repositioning
• Dermal texture alteration
• Approximate human replication (visual only)
Notably:
• Mass remains constant
• Fine biological inaccuracies detectable upon close inspection
• Replication improves with observation duration
The organism does not merely blend – it becomes.
This trait exceeds original design parameters.

3. Predatory Strategy
NEMO_03 does not pursue prey physically.
Instead, it:
1. Observes target from concealment
2. Mimics voice of known associate
3. Adopts approximate physical appearance
4. Lures prey into enclosed or low-light environment
5. Executes rapid mandibular expansion and cervical fracture
This behaviour mirrors anglerfish ambush logic – replacing light lure with psychological deception.

4. Environmental Preference
Rather than inheriting echolocation, NEMO_03 acquired behavioural traits from chiropteran DNA:
• Prefers dark
• Prefers warm
• Prefers humid / enclosed environments
• Avoids open, dry, well-lit terrain
Commonly seeks:
• Basements
• Ventilation systems
• Sewer infrastructure
• Subfloor cavities
• Attics during winter
It becomes increasingly agitated under bright light exposure.

V. Behavioural Notes
• Displays observational intelligence
• Demonstrates patience beyond predatory necessity
• Has been observed mimicking staff members without immediate attack
• Appears to “practice” forms when unobserved
Psychological profile suggests emerging self-awareness.

VI. Containment History
• Successfully contained in Adaptive Chamber 3A for 41 days
• Containment failure events linked to unexplained electromagnetic disturbances
• Security footage repeatedly corrupted prior to incident
No evidence of forced breach.
Exit path remains unidentified.

VII. Incident Report — Anomaly Crisis
Date: 17/12/20
Context: Facility-wide systems failure during classified anomaly event coinciding with early global outbreak reports.
During emergency lockdown sequence:
• Power grid destabilized
• Biological containment fields failed
• Surveillance blackout (7 minutes 13 seconds)
• NEMO_03 missing upon restoration
Last thermal signature detected near sub-basement access corridor.
Exterior breach signs discovered hours later.

VIII. Current Status
NEMO_03 is presumed active.
Given its:
• Advanced mimicry
• Form alteration ability
• Preference for inhabited enclosed spaces
• Capacity to replicate trusted individuals
Risk assessment concludes:
Direct confrontation not advised.
Verification of identity protocols mandatory in all secure facilities.

IX. Advisory Notice
If auditory anomalies occur in isolated environments – particularly voices of known individuals requesting entry – verification must be visual and tactile under high-intensity lighting conditions.
Do not respond to familiar voices in darkness.

Creature File: AILENI_04
Classification: Hyper-Regenerative Organism
Status: TERMINATED
Threat Level: HIGH (Pre-Termination)

I. Overview
AILENI_04 was the fourth and final subject produced under Project AILENI, an initiative focused on accelerated cellular regeneration and full limb restoration.
Earlier subjects demonstrated uncontrolled mitotic expansion and catastrophic organ duplication. AILENI_04 incorporated refined growth inhibitors intended to regulate regenerative signaling pathways.
Initial stabilization exceeded projections.

II. Genetic Composition Summary
Primary integrations included:
• Axolotl – limb regeneration
• Planarian flatworm – whole-body cellular reconstitution
• African spiny mouse – scarless wound healing
• Deer – antler regrowth cycle regulation

III. Physical Description
Baseline Form (Post-Stabilization):
• Height: 1.8m
• Musculature: Dense, fibrous, unusually elastic
• Dermal Layer: Smooth, hypervascularized
• Eyes: Slightly luminescent under low light
Subdermal tissue displayed constant micro-movement consistent with active cell division.

IV. Regenerative Capabilities
1. Dermal Repair
  o Full-thickness lacerations closed in under 12 seconds
2. Skeletal Restoration
  o Fractures fused within minutes
3. Limb Regrowth
  o Partial limb regeneration observed within 4 hours

V. Failure Event
On Day 6 post-stabilization:
• Regeneration activated without injury stimulus
• Redundant bone growth initiated
• Secondary organ clusters formed
• Ribcage expansion compromised cardiac function
Subject expired following systemic compression failure.

VI. Conclusion
Regenerative signalling proved impossible to localize.
AILENI_04 was terminated.
Project AILENI suspended indefinitely.
